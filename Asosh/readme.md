# Asosh

The name is derived from 'associative', playing on the first two syllables.

## Goal

Asosh aims to provide a completely and easily customizable parser and syntactical compiler tool.

__Parsing:__ Parse the input string (from an input file) into an array of word objects.

__Compiling:__ Compile the words into expressions structured with associativity properties.
